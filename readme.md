This is the task Tracker WebEOC board in development for Maricopa County EOC.
The board will be imported, via HTML into WebEOC when development is completed.
This is structure only.  Data links can only be completed from within WebEOC.
    WebEOC provides a standard .css file that many of these elements will draw from.  However, the .css file in development is intended to override some of the default style choices given on the status boards.
